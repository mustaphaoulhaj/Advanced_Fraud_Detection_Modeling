# Fraud Detection Modeling Project

## Introduction
This project focuses on developing a fraud detection model to identify potentially fraudulent transactions. The goal is to enhance the detection of fraudulent activities within a transaction dataset by employing various machine learning techniques and statistical methods.

## Data Source
The data for this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection) and spans from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2020. It includes transaction records from 1,000 credit card customers interacting with 800 different merchants. 
The dataset is used to train and test different fraud detection models.

## Methodology
1. Descriptive Statitics : Analyze the data to understand its structure or identify the correlations. Visualize the data to uncover insights.
2. Feature Engineering : Identify and create relevant features that could improve the performance of the fraud detection models. This may include feature scaling, encoding categorical variables, and generating new features.
3. Model Selection : Evaluate different machine learning models for fraud detection, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting Machines.
4. Model Evaluation : Assess the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. Select the best-performing model based on these metrics.
5. Evaluating Models with Additional Performance Metrics : Assess the models using supplementary metrics such as total cost or savings score to gain a comprehensive understanding of their performance.

## Results
The results section will provide a summary of the descriptive statistics for the fraud dataset and an overview of the model performance. This includes key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, as well as cost-based metrics. Additionally, it will feature visualizations of model performance and comparisons among different models.

## Summary
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent transactions.  We successfully developed a model with **98%** precision, significantly reducing the risk of fraud and enhancing the security of transaction systems.
